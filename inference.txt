Miss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the "busy scene." Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.

They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room. The two brothers passed thro' a number of the principal houses they visited anew to the house where the ball was to take place. They found an elegant breakfast prepared for them at eleven o'clock, after which they proceeded to the drawing-rooms, and found Miss Aubrey dressed with great splendor as a young belle, and attended by a brilliant train, which, indeed, seemed to afford her protection against the admiration of the men. She was quite enraptured by the manners and the spirit of the ladies present, with whom she conversed, and made many new acquaintances, all of whom appeared to love her. As the evening progressed, various gentlemen proposed to her, and seemed pleased with her lively conversations, but without any intention of making further advances; while one in particular appeared to have been already engaged, and who was particularly anxious to know if she had any objections to marry. This gentleman was an old friend of Mrs. Aubrey, and evidently wished to befriend both sisters. Aubrey was obliged to decline the offer, though deeply touched by the good opinion expressed of him, as well as the attention paid to himself by the other guests. But he was sorry also to do so, as he

This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.

He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past.

He talked of his former affections; told her of his love to Lady Jermyn, and of the hopes which he entertained respecting himself; and then added, with a sudden change of tlemanery, "But you are too good for me,--you have been ever devoted either to honour or virtue." She replied, with tears in her eyes, that it was impossible for her to hope more than to love him well.

The old man had told us some interesting things about him, but they were all so vague that you never knew whether he was telling the truth or not. He seemed rather queer than not; and yet I dared not ask him any questions, lest I might make matters worse by making it appear as though I did not believe in this extraordinary story. There is something too strange about it all to admit that it is true. The bard said that he had been walking about his farm from early morn until late in the afternoon, singing and playing upon various instruments, sometimes alone, and sometimes in company with others who played in different parts of the village. He played most of the time upon a guitar which he called "the poet's friend"; but his chief amusement seemd to be singing. There are few songs about the country round about; and those few are generally considered antiquated, and therefore not much listened to nowadays.

Aubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.

Ways of knowing: how cultures understand the world
At a recent NIH workshop, researchers shared their views on how biology, culture, history, and language influence human perceptions of the natural world.
How do we come to know what we know? The concept of “ways of knowing” refers to how people acquire knowledge based on their individual experiences and cultural milieu. These ways include:
- Empirical science (the study of our natural world through observation, experimentation, and measurement).
- Interpretive traditions (such as philosophical systems).
- Religious beliefs.
- Ethical frameworks.
- Oral histories and folk tales.
The NIH Workshop on WAYs of KNOWING: Culture, Biology, History, and Language in Human Perceptions of the Natural World brought together scientists from diverse fields who discussed how these different modes of knowing influence our understanding of health and disease. They also explored how scientific and medical research can benefit from insights provided by other types of knowledge.
Evolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson spoke about the importance of empiricism in
